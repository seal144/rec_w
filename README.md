## ABOUT PROJECT

This project, called Rectangle World, is a simple evolution simulator. In this world lives two kinds of creatures: plants and bugs. Plants don't subject evolution, they are only the first link in the trophic chain. Bugs are more interesting, they have two purposes: eat when hungry, mate when full. Bugs have four features (inherited from their parents): speed, size, senses and aggression.

Being fast bug have obvious earnings but it is associated with shorter life and greater energy loss when in move. Bigger bugs have advantage, because smaller bugs run away from bigger ones (when the difference is significant). Size is associated with greater energy cost of move and reproduce. When a bug is big and fast its movement energy loss grows exponentially. Bug with sharp senses have bigger field of view, which helps to find treat or lover. However, better senses involve higher energy loss and oftener noticing a bigger bug, which forces fleeing. Aggression indicates how often a bug is sharing food when eating with another bug (there are space only for two bugs near one plant). If two bugs chose to share food, each get half of the plant. If one critter chose not to share, this bug gets all the food and another one gets nothing. If two bugs chose not to share, no one gets any food. However, critters remember who didn't share with them and in future they are not so willing to share with this individual. The features of a bug determine its appearance

To reproduce bugs have to find another critter, who also wants to mate and is representative of the same species. Children inherit features after their parents with some inaccuracy. With passing generation in this small world new species arises.
